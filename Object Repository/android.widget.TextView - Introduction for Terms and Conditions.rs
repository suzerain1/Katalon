ÆON Credit Service takes your right to privacy seriously and wants you to feel comfortable using our web site. This Privacy Policy deals with personally identifiable information (referred to as Data below) that may be collected by us on our site. This Policy does not apply to other entities that we do not own or control or persons that are not our employees, agents or within our control. Acceptance of the Privacy Policy is a condition for use of this web site.

Collection of Data

Please take note that your user name, e-mail address, or other submissions that you make on this site may contain your real name or other personally identifiable information and, as a result, may appear on this site. However, at no time will ÆON Credit Service use or grant others to use any of your provided personal information, including credit or payment history details, if any. Like many web sites, we may also automatically receive general information that is contained in our server log files such as your IP address and cookie information. Information about how advertising may be served on this site (if at all) is set forth below. The web site may contain comment areas and other facilities designed to enable you to communicate with other users of the web site. You agree to use such facilities only for purposes that are proper and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this web site. You also agree to be responsible for any personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data that you disclose through the facilities which may be collected and used by any third party. As the owner and provider of the Data, you are entitled to all rights granted as a data subject under the applicable data protection laws.

Use of Data

We will use the Data you provide to customize and improve your user experience on this site, which may include marketing and website user analytics purposes. We will exert efforts so that your Data will be secure from unauthorized access and use. Your Data will not be provided to third parties unless

(i) provided for otherwise in this Privacy Policy;

(ii) we obtain your consent, such as when you choose to opt-in or opt-out to the sharing of Data;

(iii) a service provided on our site requires the interaction with or is provided by a third party, by way of example an Application Service Provider;

(iv) pursuant to legal process or law enforcement;

(v) we find that your use of this site violates this Policy, Terms of Service, other usage guidelines or as deemed reasonably necessary by us to protect our legal rights and/or property; or

(vi) this site is purchased by a third party whereby that third party will be able to use the Data in the same manner as set forth in this Policy.

In the event you choose to use links that appear on our site to visit other web sites, you are advised to read the privacy policies that appear on those sites. We occasionally use third-party contractors to perform functions for us such as site maintenance and analysis, which shall include the collation and storage of the information you provided. These entities have access to the personal information needed to perform their functions and are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of any personal information collected from the website. They are restricted from using, selling, distributing or altering these data in any way other than to provide the requested services to the website. ÆON Credit Service does not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as age, without your consent.

Editing or Deleting Your Account Information

We provide you with the ability to edit the information in your user account information that you provided to us during registration by using your personal page configuration area.

Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may make changes to this Policy from time to time. We will notify you of substantial changes to this Policy either by posting a prominent announcement on our site and/or by sending a message to the e-mail address you have provided to us contained within your user settings.

Data Protection Safeguards

While this Privacy Policy states our standards for the maintenance of Data and we will make efforts to meet them, we are not in a position to guarantee these standards. There may be factors beyond our control that may result in disclosure of data. As a consequence, we disclaim any warranties or representations relating to maintenance or nondisclosure of Data. However, we have ensured that measures have been adapted to ensure the protection of your data, the confidentiality of your personal information, and the prevention of the Data's unauthorized use.

Rights as a Data Subject

You have rights as a data subject, which includes the right to access, correction, and object to the processing, as well as the right to lodge a complaint before the National Privacy Commission.
